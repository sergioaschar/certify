----------
Quick Start (IIS users)
----------
1. Download from [https://certifytheweb.com/](https://certifytheweb.com/) and install it. Chocolatey users can alternatively `choco install certifytheweb`.
2. Click 'New Certificate', optionally choose your IIS site (binding hostnames will be auto detected, or just enter them manually). Save your settings and click 'Request Certificate'
3. All done! The certificate will renew automatically.

Advanced users can explore the different validation modes, deployment modes and other advanced options.

Development & Bug Reporting
-------------

If you have a bug or feature and you can fix the problem yourself please just:

   1. File a new issue
   2. Fork the repository
   2. Make your changes 
   3. Submit a pull request, detailing the problem being solved and testing steps/evidence
   
If you cannot provide a fix for the problem yourself, please file an issue and describe the fault with steps to reproduce.

Translation
------------

You can help translate the app by cloning the repo and installing ResXManager to easily update translation text:

Developer Build/Run Requirements:
----------------------

> - Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition (or higher) 
> - A local instance of IIS installed (for http validation, not required for DNS validation).
> - Restoring NuGet packages using "Update-Package -reinstall" can be useful where nuget restore fails.
> - The UI needs the background service to be running. You can configure Visual Studio to launch both the Certify.UI project and the Certify.Service project via Solution > Properties > Multiple Startup Projects

> **Note:**  For development you will require a publicly accessible IP mapped to the domain/subdomain you want to test with. The Let's Encrypt service will need to be able to access your test site remotely via HTTP in order to complete authorisation challenges.
> The app consists of a UI and background service. The background service must be running for the UI to operate.
